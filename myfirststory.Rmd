This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

breckies dumb ancient operating system wont run git,
I have no idea what I am doing. This is slightly terrifying.
Hurray! Breckie's computer may still be dumb and ancient, but it is no longer terrifying and will "Possibly" use Git now. Cross your fingers! things are hopeful now. okay i think its working.

Okay, day 2. I am a little less frustrated. Here is what I think is going on: You open your Rmarkdown writing project in Rstudio. This is where you do your writing, editing, creating, etc...Then if you want to send it to Git Hub to back up, you need to save the edits in Rstudio, then commit it in Git, then push it to your repository on Git Hub.
