This file provides basic instructions in my own style of language for getting started using Rmarkdown, Git, and Github. 

# This is the repository formerly known as breckmccmoney. It will now be the location of all homework assignments.

ANYWAY, once I have some content in this here repository, it will need to be formatted.
The old "My First Story" story is pretty ugly as is. You can change this using some standardized syntax right in RMarkdown.

So here are some instructions for making things prettier and/or emphasizing things that need emphasis:

In order to create Headers and Titile lines of text in different font sizes, type:

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

If you want some text to be bold, type ** on either side of your text, like asterisk asterisk bold asterisk asterisk, which looks like **bold**
If you want some text to be italicized, type * on either side of your text, asterisk Macrocystis pyrifera asterisk, which looks like *Macrocystis pyrifera*, or *italics*

If you want to make a line that looks a bit like a page break that can be used to separate ideas more drastically than a new paragraph,

Type: 
***
Likewise, if you want to quote someone with more emphasis than just using quotation marks (good for take home messages), Type:
> Take Home Message

This > is sometimes referred to as a carrot I believe but I might be wrong.

Okay, good luck and godspeed. And also, the content that will hopefully be deposited in this repository shortly will contain a sort of instruction manual for how to get things that one day might be R code or data even (god willing) up onto the internets.
