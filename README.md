This file provides basic instructions in my own style of language for getting started using Rmarkdown, Git, and Github. 

# This is the repository formerly known as breckmccmoney. It will now be the location of all homework assignments.

Okay, somehow I just (as of the afternoon of 9/7/15) fucked this readme all up. I think maybe git or I (most likely I) freaked out when some one else changed things via github so I just deleted everything between "<<<<<<<< Head" and ">>>>>>>>>" as according to "https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/" Anyway, while deleting all new changes is kind of rude to my co-author, it seems to have taken care of the "unmerged paths" or whatever the hissy fit git was having in terminal. I just wanted to submit my homework issues to Jillian! I really didn't care about README at the moment, but now it is all screwed up, and ugly, and stuff is missing, and I have no idea what happened.

One thing I did learn today is that typing "#" in front of my text doesn't do what I think it does, instead it just make my font extra large. That is obnoxious and I appologize. Maybe that is an R thing? Anyway I am going to stop doing that...


Work in progress, ya'll.

So, once I get better at depositing content in this here repository, it will need to be formatted. At the moment i am pretty bad at formatting as I go so consider this a "cheat sheet" or reminder of how to make things less ugly.

You can reformat text using some standardized syntax right in RStudio.
Once you get the hang of it, you might even remember these things and be able to type them right as you go in RStudio. Wouldn't that be great!


## ANYWAY, here are some instructions for making things prettier, less embarrassing, and/or emphasizing things that need emphasis:

***


First of all, there is an easy way to create Headers and Titile lines of text in different font sizes.

For example, let's say something is really important and you want to type it in extra large font, type one "hashtag" or "pound sign" (depending on your generation) and a space, in front of your text, such as:
# Header 1

For large font type two "hashtags" or "pound signs" before a space and your text: 
## Header 2

And for slightly larger font type three, such as:
### Header 3


If you want some text to be bold, type two asterisks on either side of your text, like "asterisk asterisk bold asterisk asterisk" or: **bold**

If you want some text to be italicized, type just one asterisk on either side of your text, like "asterisk Macrocystis pyrifera asterisk" or: *Macrocystis pyrifera*, or *italics* etc...

If you want to make a line that looks a bit like a page break that can be used to separate ideas more drastically than a new paragraph,

Type three asterisks in a row all by themselves like...

asterisk asterisk asterisk
to get this:

***

Likewise, if you want to quote someone with more emphasis than just using quotation marks (good for take home messages), Type:

> Take Home Message

I believe this > is sometimes referred to as "a carrot" in computer-person-speak, but I might be wrong.

Okay, good luck and godspeed. And also, the content that will hopefully be deposited in this repository shortly will contain a sort of instruction manual for how to get things that one day might be R code or data even (god willing) up onto the internets.
